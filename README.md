# Hoyo Value Tracker

## Overall Concept
For this project, I will make a data analytic app for managing and segregating data by category along with backend for precise DBMS handling. Clients can view data on each charcter along with their statistics. The characters statistics will then be analyized and a score will be calculated to determine how high of a value a character has.

## Language/Library
I plan on using React and D3.js for the frontend. As for the backend, I plan to use Python (Flask).
